/*
You are running a website, and you are trying to calculate your advertising revenue. 
Write a program that allows you to enter 3 pieces of data:

How many ads were watched.
What percentage of users clicked on an ad.
The average earnings per clicked ad.
Store those 3 values in a struct. Pass that struct to another function that prints each of the values. 
The print function should also print how much you made for that day (multiply the 3 fields together).
